# Overview

A [service fulfillment](#servicefulfillment) is modeled as set of service
events, each being an instance of [Service](#service). Services of one service
fulfillment should be connected in time with the properties
[nextService](#nextservice) and [previousService](#previousservice).

Five typical service status are defined as disjoint subclasses:

* A [ReservedService](#reservedservice) is in status *reserved*:\
  the service has been accepted for execution but no action has taken place.
* A [PreparedService](#preparedservice) is in status *prepared*:\
  the execution is being prepared but is has not actually started.
* A [ProvidedService](#providedservice) is in status *provided*:\
  the service is ready to be executed on request.
* A [ExecutedService](#executedservice) is in status *executed*:\
  the service is actually being executed.
* A [RejectedService](#rejectedservice) is in status *rejected*:\
  the service has been refused or stopped.

Actual services do not need to implement all of these service status. A service
is typically connected to at least one [ServiceProvider](#provider) and at
least one [ServiceConsumer](#serviceconsumer). 

The following diagram illustrates the classes and properties definied in this ontology:

```
                                   nextService / previousService
                                              ------
                                             |      |
                                             v      v
   +-----------------+   provided     +--------------------+   consumedBy   +-----------------+
   | ServiceProvider |--------------->|     Service        |--------------->| ServiceConsumer |
   |                 |<---------------|                    |<---------------|                 |

                                      |   ExecutedService  |
                                      |   RejectedService  |
                                      |                    |
                                      | ServiceFulfillment |
                                      +-----^--------------+
                                            |      ^
                                            |      |
                                             ------
                               dcterms:hasPart / dcterms:partOf
```

This ontology does not make any assumptions about types of services. Examples
of services include buying a product from a shop, lending a book from a
library, participating in a performance etc. To define service types, define a
subclass of [Service](#service).  The class [TimeTravel](#timetravel) is
included in SSSO as artifical example of a service type.

# Classes

## Service

A service is an Event or activity. Several RDF ontologies have been proposed 
for such entities, maybe because ontology engineers cannot agree on semantics:

* Dublin Core Metadata Terms
* Event ontology
* Provenance ontology
* LODE ontology (Linking Open Descriptions of Events)
* DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology
* CIDOC-CRM expressed in OWL
* Schema.org Ontology
* NEPOMUK Calendar Ontology

An SSSO Service is subclass of all of them to make happy multiple communities.

    ssso:Service a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "Service" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf 
            dctype:Event , 
            event:Event , 
            prov:Activity , 
            lode:Event , 
            dul:Event ,
            crm:E7_Activity ,
            ncal:Event ,
            schema:Event ;
            rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

Service [providers](#serviceprovider) can be connected to a service with
property [providedBy](#providedby) and service [consumers](#serviceconsumer)
can be connected to a service with property [consumedBy](#consumedBy).

The time when a service started and/or ended can be expressed as instance of
`xsd:dateTime` or `xsd:date` with properties `prov:startedAtTime` or
`schema:startDate` and `prov:endedAtTime` or `schema:endDate` respectively. The
starting time must be equal to or earlier than the ending time (unless the
service is an instance of [TimeTravel](#timetravel) and
[ExecutedService](#executedservice)).


## ServiceFulfillment

A Service fulfillment is a [Service](#service) that consists of one or more
parts. Each of these parts is also a [Service](#service) and connected to the
service fulfillment by `dcterms:partOf`. Vice versa, each instance of
[Service](#service) is also instance of [ServiceFulfillment](#servicefulfillment) 
if connected to another [Service](#service) by `dcterms:hasPart`. The parts of
a service fulfillment SHOULD be connected to each other by [nextService](#nextservice) 
and [previousService](#previousservice).

    ssso:ServiceFulfillment a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ServiceFulfillment" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf ssso:Service ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## ReservedService

A reserved service is a [Service](#service) that has been accepted by a service
provider for execution but not prepared yet. The reserved service has neither
been prepared by a service provider but only queued for further processing.
A typical example is a product order that has been placed but not payed yet or
a payed ticket to a theater performance.

    ssso:ReservedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ReservedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf ssso:Service ;
        owl:disjointWith 
          ssso:PreparedService, ssso:ProvidedService, 
          ssso:ExecutedService, ssso:RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## PreparedService

A prepared service is being prepared to be provided or executed. A typical example 
is a product that is being send to its consumer.

    ssso:PreparedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ReservedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf ssso:Service ;
        owl:disjointWith
          ssso:ReservedService, ssso:ProvidedService, 
          ssso:ExecutedService, ssso:RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## ProvidedService

A provided service is being made available for immediate execution. A typical example is a
product that is ready for being picked up by its consumer.

    ssso:ReservedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ReservedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf ssso:Service ;
        owl:disjointWith
          ssso:ReservedService, ssso:PreparedService, 
          ssso:ExecutedService, ssso:RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## ExecutedService

An executed service represents the actual execution event of fulfillment of a
service. A typical example is a theater performance that is being played.

    ssso:ExecutedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ExecutedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf ssso:Service ;
        owl:disjointWith
          ssso:ReservedService, ssso:PreparedService, 
          ssso:ProvidedService, ssso:RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## RejectedService

A rejected service has been rejected by its provider or by its consumer. The
rejection may be infinite or it may be followed by another service when the
reason for rejection has been removed.

    ssso:RejectedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "RejectedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf ssso:Service ;
        owl:disjointWith
          ssso:ReservedService, ssso:PreparedService, 
          ssso:ProvidedService, ssso:ExecutedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## ServiceProvider

A service provider is an entity that is responsible for providing a
[Service](#service).  Typical providers are instances of `foaf:Agent`, such as
organizations or people, but the Simple Service Status Ontology does not put
any constraints on the nature of providers.

    ssso:ServiceProvider a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ServiceProvider" ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## ServiceConsumer

A service consumer is an entity that is requesting or consuming a
[Service](#service).  Typical consumers are instances of `foaf:Agent`, such as
organizations or people, but the Simple Service Status Ontology does not put
any constraints on the nature of consumers.

    ssso:ServiceConsumer a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ServiceConsumer" ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## TimeTravel

An event which ends before it has been started. Details have been implemented
in the future.

    ssso:TimeTravel a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "TimeTravel" ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

# Properties

        rdfs:label "consumedBy" ;
        rdfs:domain ssso:Service ;
        rdfs:range ssso:ServiceConsumer ;
        owl:inverseOf ssso:consumed ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## nextService

Relates a service instances to another service instance which is following in time.
The starting time of the following service instance MUST be equal or later then the
ending time of the previous service (unless one of the services is an instance of 
[TimeTravel](#timetravel) and [ExecutedService](#executedservice)).

    ssso:nextService a owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "nextService" ;
        rdfs:domain ssso:Service ;
        rdfs:range  ssso:Service ;
        owl:inverseOf ssso:previousService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .

## previousService

Relates a service instances to another service instance which is preceding in time.
The ending time of the previousg service instance MUST be equal or earlier then the
starting time of the next service  (unless one of the services is an instance of 
[TimeTravel](#timetravel) and [ExecutedService](#executedservice)).

    ssso:previousService a owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "previousService" ;
        rdfs:domain ssso:Service ;
        rdfs:range  ssso:Service ;
        owl:inverseOf ssso:nextService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy <> .
