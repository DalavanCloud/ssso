# Introduction

The **Simple Service Status Ontology (SSSO)** is an RDF ontology for typical
status in fulfillment of a service. A service fulfillment is modeled as chain
of service events, each being an instance of a subclass of [Service](#service).
A service is typically connected to at least one service [Provider](#provider)
and at least one service [Consumer](#consumer). 

SSSO defines five disjoint service subclasses:

* [ReservedService](#reservedservice)
* [PreparedService](#preparedservice)
* [ProvidedService](#providedservice)
* [ExecutedService](#executedservice)
* [RejectedService](#rejectedservice)

## Namespaces

The namespace of this ontology may change until final release:

    @prefix ssso: <http://purl.org/NET/ssso> .
    @prefix : <http://purl.org/NET/ssso> .
    @base   <http://purl.org/NET/ssso> .

In addition the following namespace prefixes are used:

    @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
    @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
    @prefix dctype: <http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/> .
    @prefix event: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#> .
    @prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .
    @prefix dul: <http://www.loa-cnr.it/ontologies/DUL.owl#> .
    @prefix lode: <http://linkedevents.org/ontology/> .

## Ontology

    <http://purl.org/NET/ssso> a owl:Ontology ;
        rdfs:label "SSSO" .

# Classes

## Service

A service is an Event or activity. Several RDF ontologies have been proposed 
for such entities, maybe because ontology engineers cannot agree on semantics:

* Dublin Core Metadata Terms
* Event ontology
* Provenance ontology
* LODE ontology (Linking Open Descriptions of Events)
* DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology (`dul`)
* CIDOC-CRM expressed in OWL

An SSSO Service is subclass of all of them to make happy multiple communities.

    :Service a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "Service" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf    
            dctype:Event, event:Event, prov:Activity, lode:Event, dul:Event ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

The time when a service started and/or ended can be expressed as instance of
`xsd:dateTime` with properties `prov:startedAtTime` and  `prov:endedAtTime`,
respectively. Service [providers](#provider) can be connected to a service
with property [providedBy](#providedby) and service [consumers](#consumer) 
can be connected to a service with property [consumedBy](#consumedBy).

## ReservedService

A reserved service is a [Service](#service) that has been accepted by a service
provider for execution but not prepared yet. The reserved service has neither
been prepared by a service provider but only queued for further processing.
A typical example is a product order that has been placed but not payed yet.

    :ReservedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ReservedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Service ;
        owl:disjointWith :PreparedService, :ProvidedService, :ExecutedService, :RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## PreparedService

A prepared service is being prepared to be provided or executed. A typical example 
is a product that is being send to its consumer.

    :PreparedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ReservedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Service ;
        owl:disjointWith :ReservedService, :ProvidedService, :ExecutedService, :RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## ProvidedService

A provided service is being made available for immediate execution. A typical example is a
product that is ready for being picked up by its consumer.

    :ReservedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ReservedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Service ;
        owl:disjointWith :ReservedService, :PreparedService, :ExecutedService, :RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## ExecutedService

An executed service represents the actual execution of fulfillment of a service.

    :ExecutedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "ExecutedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Service ;
        owl:disjointWith :ReservedService, :PreparedService, :ProvidedService, :RejectedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## RejectedService

A rejected service has been rejected by its provider or by its consumer. The
rejection may be infinite or it may be followed by another service when the
reason for rejection has been removed.

    :RejectedService a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "RejectedService" ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Service ;
        owl:disjointWith :ReservedService, :PreparedService, :ProvidedService, :ExecutedService ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## Provider

A provider is an entity that is responsible for providing a [Service](#service).
Typical providers are instances of `foaf:Agent`, such as organizations or people,
but the Simple Service Status Ontology does not put any constraints on the nature
of providers.

    ssso:Provider a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "provider" ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## Consumer

A consumer is an entity that is requesting or consuming a [Service](#service).
Typical consumers are instances of `foaf:Agent`, such as organizations or people,
but the Simple Service Status Ontology does not put any constraints on the nature
of consumers.

    ssso:Provider a owl:Class ;
        rdfs:label "consumer" ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

# Properties

## providedBy

Relates a [Service](#service) instance to a [Provider](#provider) instance.

    :providedBy a owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "providedBy" ;
        rdfs:domain :Service ;
        rdfs:range :Provider ;
        owl:inverseOf :provided ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## provided

Relates a [Provider](#provider) instance to a  [Service](#service) instance .

    :providedBy a owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "provided" ;
        rdfs:domain :Provider ;
        rdfs:range :Service ;
        owl:inverseOf :providedBy ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## consumedBy

Relates a [Service](#service) instance to a [Consumer](#consumer) instance.

    ssso:consumedBy a owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "consumedBy" ;
        rdfs:domain :Service ;
        rdfs:range :Consumer ;
        owl:inverseOf :consumed ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .

## consumed

Relates a [Consumer](#consumer) instance to a [Service](#service) instance.

    ssso:consumedBy a owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "consumed" ;
        rdfs:domain :Consumer ;
        rdfs:range :Service ;
        owl:inverseOf :consumedBy ;
        rdfs:isDefinedBy ssso: .
